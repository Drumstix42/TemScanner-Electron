# Temtem OCR Autohotkey Script
The `TemtemOCR.ahk` file is the original source code for the Autohotkey script. It is not required to run the application, but is provided for reference.

If you have Autohotkey installed, you should backup the original TemtemOCR.exe file and compile the script yourself. You can do this by right-clicking the TemtemOCR.ahk file and selecting "Compile Script".

Make sure to keep the filename the same, `TemtemOCR.exe` so that the Electron application can find it and automatically run it when the application is started.
